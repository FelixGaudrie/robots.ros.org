Reachy is super versatile.

Whether youâ€™re a researcher, an academic, a creative or an innovation professional, Reachy is probably the best solution for you to learn, explore and develop AI and robotics with an open source projet.

Reachy is designed to evolve among humans. He is safe and pleasant to interact with and he can make himself useful by taking/giving objects, welcome and give directions to people. He is also a perfect platform to explore and understand stat-of-the-art AI & Robotics technologies.

Since this year a new mobile base offers seamless and self-detecting navigation to the robot. With 3 omni wheels, multiple sensors and a LiDAR for environment mapping, Reachy has now access to more applications and a wider working space.
